// An Arithmetic Progression is defined as one 
// in which there is a constant difference between 
// the consecutive terms of a given series of numbers. 
// You are provided with consecutive elements of an 
// Arithmetic Progression. There is however one hitch:
// exactly one term from the original series is 
// missing from the set of numbers which have been 
// given to you. The rest of the given series is the 
// same as the original AP. Find the missing term.

// You have to write the function findMissing(list), 
// list will always be at least 3 numbers. The missing 
// term will never be the first or last one.




var findMissing = function (list) {  
  return list;
